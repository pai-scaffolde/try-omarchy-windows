# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Choosing the raw VirtIO audio device in Omarchy's audio menu no longer turns
  off volume sync; Omarchy switches back to the Windows device (#277).

## v0.10.1 - 2026-10-06

- Large images copied from Windows reach Omarchy without stalling.
- Portable installs on exFAT start again after the first launch.

## v0.10.0 - 2026-10-05

- On NVIDIA graphics, GPU mode no longer freezes when Media Player opens, and
  GTK4 apps such as Files open instead of crashing. Guest Vulkan apps use
  OpenGL there (#276).
- Resources, Graphics, displays and the shared folder now apply when Omarchy
  restarts, as Settings promises.
- The Windows key no longer gets stuck held in Windows after switching between
  Windows and Omarchy.
- Scrolling Settings no longer changes dropdown values.
- The camera and audio bridges accept only Omarchy's own connection, the LAN
  firewall helper only adds rules for Omarchy's QEMU, and uninstall refuses a
  folder that is not a Try Omarchy data folder.
- Volume and mute stay in sync between Omarchy and Windows, including Windows
  playback device changes. Turn off **Sync volume with Windows** in Settings to
  control them independently.
- Night light now warms the VM display from the existing menu and keyboard shortcut.
- Omarchy starts when a saved LAN adapter is unavailable, pauses only its
  forwards for that launch, and resumes them on a later launch when it returns.
- The launcher warns when Omarchy's Windows drive is running low or almost
  full, with guidance for Reclaim and moving the data in Settings.
- Notification popups appear in Omarchy again. They stay hidden while the
  screen is locked or the screensaver is up (#298).
- When the Omarchy desktop stops responding, the launcher saves diagnostics and
  offers to restart, in CPU mode if GPU rendering froze. Your session stays
  open until you choose (#303).
- After Windows sleep, Omarchy resumes, or shows **Resume Omarchy** in the tray
  with diagnostics saved if it cannot. Restarting or signing out of Windows
  shuts Omarchy down cleanly first, and the next start offers recovery if that
  did not finish (#304, #216).
- An occupied port pauses only that forward, and a declined firewall prompt
  pauses only LAN forwards, instead of stopping the launch. Portable installs
  keep their firewall rules between launches and clean up rules left by
  installs that are gone (#302).
- Clipboard sync stays responsive during large file copies, retries copies made
  while Windows is busy, handles more image formats, and rejects images too
  large to convert safely. Only Omarchy's QEMU can connect to it (#299).
- Dropping files works when the launcher runs as administrator, rejected drops
  explain why, received files open without taking focus, Transfers opens once,
  and the tray icon returns when Explorer starts late (#301).
- Moved installations keep working after a drive letter change, an interrupted
  uninstall can be finished safely, portable copies refuse FAT32 drives up
  front, and the shared folder is refused when your Windows home folder is
  unavailable (#300).
- VM windows open on the right monitor at the right size, return on screen
  after a monitor is unplugged, and no longer take focus during boot and
  shutdown (#297).
- Omarchy follows your Windows display language, Dvorak, US-International and
  Turkish F layouts, and reports battery state more reliably, including
  multiple batteries (#296).
- Cameras keep working through format changes, one unreadable audio device no
  longer hides the others, and changing audio devices during playback no
  longer shows a save error (#295).
- Keys can no longer stay held in Omarchy after a dropped connection,
  AltGr+End no longer sends Ctrl+Alt+Delete, and both Win keys work
  independently (#294).
- **Update > Omarchy** no longer flashes a configuration error banner while it
  installs (#305).
- Omarchy starts right away instead of waiting for updates. Updates download in
  the background while you use it, resume after interruptions, use the Windows
  proxy settings, and install the next time Omarchy starts, or right away with
  **Restart to update** in the tray (#307).
- CPU rendering mode now really limits the processor features Omarchy sees,
  and PowerToys and AutoHotkey can see the Win key while Omarchy runs (#306).
- Omarchy waits for Windows to finish loading a newly updated runtime instead
  of giving up and retrying on slow first starts.
- Images copied in Windows keep their exact pixels when pasted into Omarchy.
- The recovery choices shown when Omarchy stops responding stay above the
  Omarchy window.

## v0.9.0 - 2026-10-04

- Audio opens Windows playback and recording devices at their own sample rate,
  falling back to the default device and 48 kHz. A hidden volume reduction in
  Omarchy's audio routing is removed, so Omarchy plays as loud as Windows, and
  volume and mute changes you make survive audio device changes (#278, #277).
- Precision touchpads scroll smoothly vertically and horizontally instead of in
  whole wheel steps. Ordinary mouse wheels keep their normal steps (#280).
- Omarchy's battery details show the design and full-charge capacity, health,
  cycle count, manufacturer, model and chemistry that Windows reports (#281).
- Image Viewer and Media Player in GPU mode share images with the Windows GPU
  driver only in formats the driver supports, and keep per-plane memory
  requirements for multi-plane images (#284).
- Media Player plays video in CPU rendering mode instead of closing at
  startup (#283).
- Settings no longer leaves old text behind when scrolling at higher display
  scaling (#275, #273).
- The launcher is available in Simplified Chinese (#272, thanks @Dazzle-sys).
  Every launcher window now comes from the translation catalog, and the new
  translator guide and tooling check for missing strings and changed
  placeholders (#268, #269, #270, #271).
- The runtime moves to r21.
- Screensaver branding fits small windows, falling back to Omarchy when needed.
- Update > Omarchy explains when the Omarchy disk needs free space and where
  to increase its capacity in Settings. The first-run update notice uses normal
  priority, and power menus show "Managed by Windows".
- Chromium supports Wayland input methods, new input profiles include Chewing
  for Traditional Chinese, and zh-TW/zh-Hant text prefers Noto CJK TC fonts.
  Existing customized guest files are kept during compatibility catch-up.
- Update > Omarchy no longer prints "Installation aborted" for the camera and
  battery modules when the guest's kernel headers catch up with the launcher's
  kernel. DKMS now takes those modules over and puts the launcher's copies back
  if the headers move on.
- Update > Omarchy no longer asks to reboot for a new kernel on installs older
  than their launcher. The launcher supplies the kernel, so that reboot never
  changed anything.
- Every Settings page and the Help text are available in Korean (#265, thanks
  @seunghan91).

## v0.8.0 - 2026-10-01

- Omarchy's window stays invisible while Omarchy boots and fades in once the
  desktop and wallpaper are drawn. The setup window stays up with the starter
  keys and says when the desktop is starting, and Cancel shuts Omarchy down.
  The first start with your own account still shows the window for Omarchy's
  setup form. The network card's boot ROM and the kernel's EDD probe no longer
  print on screen.
- The window keeps the place and size you gave it while Omarchy starts and shuts
  down. Starting Try Omarchy while it runs brings the window forward, and a
  second installation whose shortcut is taken says where to start it.
- The window title stays "Try Omarchy" instead of briefly showing QEMU's.
- Omarchy pauses before Windows sleeps, including Modern Standby, and resumes
  on wake. A pause you made yourself is left alone.
- Files copied before Omarchy started that are gone by then no longer show a
  transfer error.
- Settings counts the running Omarchy's memory as available for the next boot.
- The launcher is available in Korean (#256, thanks @seunghan91). Every Settings
  page and its messages can now be translated, and `TRY_OMARCHY_UI_LANGUAGE`
  picks a language without changing Windows.
- The importer says "1 file" rather than "1 files".
- The guest moves to Omarchy 4.0.4. Its switch to Omarchy's own kernel is
  skipped, since the launcher supplies the kernel.

## v0.7.1 - 2026-10-01

- Security: the Linux importer only passes package and Flatpak names from the
  trial to pacman, yay and Flatpak when they are valid names, and always after
  `--`. A crafted trial could otherwise hand yay an option that runs another
  program.
- Security: the importer only runs commands from the system folders, with a
  PATH of just those. A script the import put in `~/.local/bin` could otherwise
  run in place of mise, sudo or the package tools when that folder came first
  in PATH. AUR builds ignore the home folder's yay, makepkg and git settings,
  and sudo forgets its cached password before imported settings run (mise, the
  Hyprland check, the theme switch).
- Security: trial account homes must be under `/home` without `.` or `..`
  parts, and links on the trial disk are followed inside the trial only, so a
  crafted trial cannot point the importer at other files on the computer.
- The importer no longer prints control characters from file names, checks
  service, theme and background names, applies your umask to imported files,
  and mounts its ID-mapped copy of the trial with nodev, nosuid and noexec.
- The importer's list says that everything checked comes along and Enter
  continues.
- The launcher's About and update screens, first-launch questions and Settings
  section titles are available in Simplified Chinese (#246, thanks
  @Dazzle-sys).

## v0.7.0 - 2026-09-30

- Install Omarchy next to Windows and bring your trial setup along. Open
  Settings > Recovery > Install Omarchy for a short checklist,
  buttons for Windows settings and Disk Management, and the import command.
  BitLocker status is checked through Windows without PowerShell or elevation.
- Import settings, files and app data from the Windows trial into your Linux
  account. Unchanged defaults stay in place, changed files are backed up before
  replacement, and a repeat import keeps your later edits. Browser profiles
  and sign-ins are optional.
- `try-omarchy-export` includes the same importer with its selected files,
  for moving to another PC or replacing Windows.
- First-launch screens and Settings use the updated Try Omarchy branding,
  clearer sections and native Windows controls.
- Remember a selected USB device before starting Omarchy, so it can attach
  on the next launch. Disconnected saved devices stay visible in Settings.
- Follow Windows time-zone changes while preserving a time zone you chose
  yourself inside Omarchy.

## v0.6.2 - 2026-09-29

- Security: SSH no longer accepts the quick-start account's public password.
  With a port forward to guest port 22, and especially a LAN forward, anyone
  who could reach the port could log in as `omarchy` / `omarchy` and use its
  passwordless sudo. The quick-start account now accepts only SSH keys, which
  Try Omarchy authorizes for you. Existing quick-start installs get the change
  on their first boot after the update. Your own accounts keep password login.
- New installs now preselect your own account on the first-launch screen. The
  quick start (`omarchy` / `omarchy`) is still one click away. Existing
  installs keep the choice they made.
- The quick-start welcome notice suggests running `passwd` to set your own
  password.
- Setup checks for enough free space to unpack the Omarchy image before it
  downloads, instead of running out partway through.

## v0.6.1 - 2026-09-29

- Settings > General has a "Send Alt+Tab to Omarchy while its window is
  focused" checkbox. It stays on by default. Turn it off and Alt+Tab opens the
  Windows task switcher again. The change applies without restarting Omarchy.
- On laptops with Modern Standby, Omarchy no longer drops to a black screen or
  the login screen when Windows wakes after more than a few minutes of sleep.
  Core guest services were being restarted on wake because their watchdog
  timers ran out while Omarchy was frozen.
- A monitor scale set in `~/.config/hypr/monitors.lua` stays after a theme
  switch or `hyprctl reload` instead of returning to the automatic scale.
- Guest packages are refreshed to current Arch versions.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-09-27

- Unlock 1Password with Windows Hello. If you install 1Password in Omarchy and
  have paired Windows Hello for sudo, run
  `sudo try-omarchy-windows-hello onepassword enable`, then turn on
  1Password's "Unlock using system authentication". Its unlock button then
  shows one Windows Hello prompt, with the guest password as the fallback.
- Drop Windows files onto an Omarchy app, such as a browser upload area or an
  editor, and the app receives them. The files also stay in Downloads. Drops on
  a Files folder still copy straight into that folder.
- Local port forwards changed in Settings apply while Omarchy runs. LAN
  forwards and forwards to guest port 22 still change at the next launch.
- Update > Omarchy installs packages that newer images added for Try Omarchy
  features, so older installs get them too.
- Windows Hello sudo accepts requests only from this Omarchy's own VM, refuses
  sudo from SSH sessions into the guest, recovers when a request is
  interrupted, and uses the password for 30 seconds after a canceled prompt.
- `settings.json` saved with a UTF-8 byte-order mark (for example by Notepad or
  PowerShell) opens normally.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-09-26

- Approve guest `sudo` with Windows Hello. It is opt-in: run
  `sudo try-omarchy-windows-hello enable` in Omarchy, confirm with the guest
  password, and approve the Windows passkey prompt. Each `sudo` then shows one
  Windows Hello prompt, only while the Omarchy window is in front; cancel it to
  type the password. `disable` removes the passkey.
- Switching themes no longer blanks the Omarchy window or snaps a restored
  window back to an older size.
- The Omarchy window's title bar follows the Windows light or dark app theme,
  including when it changes while Omarchy runs.
- Holding Alt and tapping Tab now keeps Alt held in Omarchy, so window
  switchers that stay open while Alt is down cycle normally.
- Setup finishes from an already downloaded file when its download link stops
  working, as long as the file matches its checksum.
- Update the guest's Arch packages.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-09-26

- Pinch to zoom on a Windows 11 Precision Touchpad. It is on by default in GPU
  mode with one display, and `-disable-pinch` turns it off. Existing guests
  pick up the touchpad rules on their first boot of the new image; a guest
  whose Hyprland `input.lua` cannot be updated safely keeps ordinary touchpad
  input.
- Send Ctrl+Alt+Delete to Omarchy with Ctrl+Alt+End while its window is
  focused. Windows reserves Ctrl+Alt+Delete for its security screen, so it
  cannot be passed through.
- A Hyprland `input.lua` exported to a real Omarchy install no longer fails on
  the missing Try Omarchy rules file.
- Update the guest to Linux 7.2.7 and systemd 262 with current Arch packages.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-09-24

- Switch Windows playback and recording devices while Omarchy runs. Saving
  audio choices in Settings reroutes the running VM, and Omarchy's own audio
  picker lists the Windows speakers and microphones so a choice made there is
  saved back to Windows. Choices carry across guest reboots.
- An idle VM no longer holds the Windows speaker open before anything plays.
- Update the bundled runtime to the source-built r20c WINQ-EMU build. Turning
  microphone access on or off still takes effect at the next VM start.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-09-23

- Open native Windows Settings from the Omarchy launcher and mirror the host
  laptop's battery and AC state inside the guest.
- Return unused guest RAM to Windows through the source-built r19 WHPX runtime
  while keeping the guest's configured memory capacity available for reuse.
- Approve specific Windows executables in Settings and launch them from the
  Omarchy app menu; removing approval revokes later launches.
- Choose the Windows monitor for fullscreen Omarchy, with primary-display
  fallback when a saved monitor is disconnected.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-09-23

First normal 0.x release. Existing preview installations keep their guest
disk, files, and settings when updating. The signed v0.0.20-preview bridge lets
older launchers reach this version.

- Optionally launch Omarchy directly at Windows sign-in, using a per-user
  shortcut that follows fullscreen settings and moves or uninstalls with its
  installation. Restored copies require a fresh sign-in choice.
- Open a pre-boot launcher with General, Devices, Advanced, and Recovery pages,
  then start Omarchy from the same window. Shortcuts can optionally start the
  desktop directly while keeping a separate Settings shortcut.
- Choose Windows playback and recording devices before boot, with safe fallback
  to the default device when a saved endpoint is unavailable.
- Send Alt+Tab and Alt+Shift+Tab to the focused Omarchy desktop; use Ctrl+Alt+Tab
  to reach the Windows task switcher.
- Offer an experimental, opt-in Precision Touchpad pinch bridge on supported
  Windows 11 laptops. It remains disabled by default while broader hardware
  testing continues.
- Support nested Linux virtualization on hosts that provide it while retaining
  a normal boot when the host refuses nested virtualization.
- Optionally start Omarchy immediately from its Windows Start-menu and Desktop
  shortcuts while keeping the separate Settings shortcut available.
- Choose a camera and turn camera or microphone access off in Settings.
- Find everyday controls in General, Devices, Advanced and Recovery pages, with
  memory shown in GB and keyboard navigation through the full form.
- Check the launcher version and signed update feed from About, or turn automatic
  launcher update checks off. Linux updates remain separate inside Omarchy.
- Report failed file transfers without a blocking dialog, so dropping a file
  during startup cannot prevent later drops from working.
- Preserve another installation's Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts when setting
  up a second copy. Command-line restore now creates launchers inside the
  restored folder and leaves global shortcuts with their current owner. A
  second install now offers folder-local launchers when those shortcuts are
  occupied, and remembers the choice instead of repeating it every launch.
- Offer a structured bug-report form and a documented diagnostics bundle so
  hardware and startup problems arrive with useful details.

## v0.0.20-preview - 2026-09-19

- Use the Windows camera in guest apps, with capture starting on demand and
  stopping when the app closes it.
- Enable microphone input alongside audio playback, with playback-only and
  silent fallbacks when an audio device cannot initialize.
- Drop Windows files into an open local Files folder without a transfer window
  taking focus. Unrecognized destinations use Downloads with a notification;
  duplicate names keep both files.
- Deliver complete matching kernel modules to existing guests, including TUN
  and the camera driver, and retry interrupted delivery on the next boot.
- Recover from orphaned pacman locks left by interrupted updates while preserving
  locks owned by a live transaction.
- Pause the guest while Windows sleeps and resume it on wake with clock sync.
- Refresh guest packages and move the guest kernel to 7.2.6.

## v0.0.19-preview - 2026-09-15

- Create portable copies of normal installations directly as verified QCOW2
  disks, budgeting nonzero blocks instead of staging a backup and raw restore.
- Copy existing portable installations directly too, with authenticated backing
  images, independent output disks and no intermediate raw materialization.
- Retry transient Windows file locks during move and snapshot publication.
- Repair duplicate runtime command ownership so existing guests keep the Neovim
  helpers across an update and the package database stays clean.
- Keep the packaged Neovim skeleton in new-user homes, restoring the Omarchy
  theme symlink the factory builder dropped. Compatibility revision 22 delivers
  the same link to existing guests and `catch-up` restores it for users who
  lost it, clearing the `omarchy-nvim` missing-file warning.

## v0.0.18-preview - 2026-09-13

- Publish the tested Windows preview, including the previously unpublished
  v0.0.15–17 improvements below.
- Add snapshots, verified rollback, native file-transfer windows, and stronger
  move, restore, clipboard, and disk-reclaim recovery.
- Ship the tested r15 runtime and compatibility-20 guest with Vulkan video,
  multiple-display, Unicode-path, shortcut, and guest-session fixes.
- Record physical Windows acceptance and explicitly retain webcam capture,
  accelerated saved sessions, portable lifecycle, and broader hardware coverage
  as remaining preview work.
- Thank external contributors and community reporters in the
  [full release notes](.github/release-notes/v0.0.18-preview.md).

## v0.0.17-preview

- Add file and folder copy/paste between Windows and Omarchy, with bounded
  snapshots and preserved originals.
- Expose reclaim and its status in the tray, report rejected requests correctly,
  and use a private temporary file during preparation.
- Keep Settings accessible on smaller screens and add help for everyday controls.

Development candidate; Windows acceptance remains pending.

## v0.0.16-preview

- Preserve native monitor settings and the Omarchy runtime location when
  restoring a configuration export.
- Report incomplete package or theme restoration and retain separate backups
  when restoring more than once.

Release candidate. Physical Windows and native Omarchy restore acceptance
remain required before publication.

## v0.0.15-preview

- Added a Settings flow for moving stopped installations, with verified copying
  and recovery if activation is interrupted.
- Updated the guest to Omarchy 4.0.3. Existing installations can update through
  Update > Omarchy while preserving their files and settings.
- Fixed browser theme permissions, build-account ownership of system files,
  and icon names that caused package update hooks to fail.
- Added missing media tools and upstream system defaults.
- Restored lock-screen authentication for fresh and existing guests.
- Fixed upgrade notices arriving before desktop notifications are ready.
- Reduced empty-block scanning during restore and fixed short reads in reclaim.
- Improved guest package refresh checks and draft PR creation.

Release candidate. Automated checks and Windows VM recovery tests pass; signed
candidate and physical Windows acceptance remain required before publication.

## v0.0.14-preview - 2026-09-05

### Features
- The guest follows the Windows display language: the launcher passes it along with the time zone and keyboard layout, and the guest generates that locale and makes it the default for the next login. `-locale` overrides it. Existing guests gain this with the next guest-image update.
- A runtime archive that is unchanged between releases is kept instead of being downloaded and unpacked again.
- Existing guests catch up with the image defaults on the first boot after an image update, without touching anything the person changed: an untouched `monitors.lua` gets the current QEMU profile (so CPU rendering starts with animations off there too), the "no gaps" and "single-window aspect ratio" toggles an older image switched on are removed when they are still the seeded copies, and Suspend leaves the system menu.

### Fixes
- Choosing Suspend inside Omarchy no longer freezes the VM window. The guest can no longer enter the S3 or S4 sleep states; a suspend request falls through to suspend-to-idle and the lock screen, and new guests have Omarchy's suspend-off toggle on so the system menu does not offer it.
- New guest images include the Noto CJK fonts, so Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text renders instead of boxes.

## v0.0.13-preview - 2026-09-05

### Features
- Automatic rendering now remembers when this PC cannot run the GPU path and goes straight to CPU rendering on later launches, retrying after a runtime or display-driver change, once a day, or when GPU is chosen in the new Rendering setting. A pending runtime update on a PC that already runs on CPU rendering is kept instead of being rolled back and downloaded again on every launch.
- Guest CPUs and RAM are sized to the machine: all logical processors but two (between two and eight) and a third of the RAM (4 to 8 GiB on CPU rendering; GPU rendering keeps its 6 GiB), with a Guest CPUs setting and `-cpus` to override.
- The guest image now includes fcitx5, so Omarchy's input method service no longer fails and restarts every two seconds for the whole session, and the CapsLock compose sequences work. Existing guests keep their packages, so on them the service now waits quietly until fcitx5 is installed (`sudo pacman -S fcitx5 fcitx5-gtk fcitx5-qt`).
- Print Screen inside the Omarchy window now goes only to Omarchy; Windows' own screen capture stays out of the way until you switch back.
- New guests on CPU rendering start with Hyprland animations off, since every animation frame is CPU time on llvmpipe; a choice in `looknfeel.lua` still wins. Existing guests keep their current setting.
- `TryOmarchy.exe -reclaim` while Omarchy runs gives the space of deleted Omarchy files back to Windows: the guest writes zeros over its free space within a budget the Windows drive can spare, and after the next shutdown the launcher turns those zero blocks back into holes in the disk file. Needs the current guest image.
- A small guest agent keeps the Omarchy clock in step with Windows: the launcher sends the host time when the guest connects, every five minutes, and right after Windows resumes from sleep, and the guest corrects itself when it has drifted by more than two seconds. Existing guests gain this with the next guest-image update.
- Images now cross the clipboard in both directions: a screenshot or picture copied in Windows pastes into Omarchy as PNG, and an image copied in Omarchy pastes into Windows apps. Text keeps working as before. Existing guests gain this with the next guest-image update.
- The guest follows the Windows time zone and default keyboard layout. Each is applied when it changes on the Windows side, so a layout or zone chosen inside Omarchy stays until Windows changes; `-timezone` and `-keyboard` override this for a launch. Existing guests gain this with the next guest-image update.
- The VM window remembers its size and position: a windowed launch reopens where the window was last left when that spot is still on a connected display, with the guest console sized to match.
- Try Omarchy registers under Windows Apps & features and can be removed from there, from **Remove Try Omarchy** in Settings, or with `-uninstall`. Removal offers a full backup first and deletes only this installation's shortcuts, registry entry, saved location, and data folder.

### Fixes
- Restore now budgets free space from the backup's compressed size instead of the sparse files' nominal size, so a 10 GB backup no longer demands 33 GB free. Restored files keep the modification times their receipts recorded, so a restored copy does not re-download its image and runtime on first launch, and a restore from Settings no longer asks about shortcuts again.
- New guest users no longer start with the "no gaps" and "single-window aspect ratio" Hyprland toggles switched on, which silently overrode gaps, border size, and rounding set in `~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.lua` (#32). Existing guests keep their current toggles; run `omarchy-hyprland-window-gaps-toggle` once to turn gaps back on.
- The Settings text under the SSH key row is no longer painted over by the label above it, and messages logged before the session log opens, such as the restored-payload decision after an interrupted update, now appear at the top of the log.

Thanks to [solkkku](https://github.com/solkkku) for reporting the Hyprland config override (#32).

## v0.0.12-preview - 2026-09-05

### Features
- Added backup, restore, and reset controls to Settings for stopped standard installs, plus `-backup` and `-restore` command-line options. Backups include the guest disk, boot files, bundled runtime, and settings, and every file is checksum-verified during restore. Restore creates a separate installation with its own launch and Settings shortcuts, so existing installations and backups are never replaced.
- Reset now offers a full backup first, prepares the new disk before moving the old one, and keeps the previous disk in a recovery folder. A failed or cancelled backup stops the reset.
- Added disk-capacity controls for standard installs, with in-place growth, current capacity and Windows free-space information. Lowering the setting never shrinks an existing disk.
- New standard installs now ask whether to use the default Local AppData folder or a different local drive or folder before downloading the runtime and guest image. Alternate locations are checked for write access and free space, remembered across launches, and carried into Start-menu and Desktop shortcuts.
- Install locations and shared folders are now chosen with the Windows folder picker. Unreadable preferences prompt an optional repair that preserves the original file and leaves guest files untouched.
- The app icon, setup splash, and VM window now use the official Omarchy mark.

### Fixes
- Added stable-release update support, including a bridge for older preview launchers and recovery-state compatibility. Stable installs stay on stable releases.
- Fixed clipboard sharing after reconnects and when copying an earlier value again. Guest copies keep trailing newlines, failed sends are retried, and overlapping transfers no longer suppress a later copy. Existing guest disks receive the updated bridge with this release's guest payload.
- Interrupted setup can reuse a completed download after a server outage or an ignored resume request, with the checksum verified before use. Failed runtime extraction keeps the verified archive for the next attempt, and short disk writes or oversized responses are detected.
- Cancelling setup on an existing installation now removes only launcher staging files. Unrelated `.part` files, shared folders, retained recovery data, and linked guest folders are left alone.
- Portable reset now prepares the new disk before retaining the old disk and its backing identity in a recovery folder, and rolls back if publication fails. Recovery data also survives a cancelled setup after an interrupted reset.
- Updated active download, update, issue, clone, and module links after the repository moved to `omacom`. Signed update manifests and existing guest and runtime receipts remain compatible with the old release base, so the transfer does not force a payload refresh or strand older launchers.

Thanks to [tcballard](https://github.com/tcballard) for the official Omarchy mark in the app branding, [7Wdev](https://github.com/7Wdev) for requesting install-location and disk controls, and [Sperum](https://github.com/Sperum) for the backup request behind the new backup and restore controls.

## v0.0.11-preview - 2026-09-03

### Features
- Standard installs now offer a dedicated `Omarchy Shared` folder for moving files between Windows and Omarchy. It is opt-in, can be disabled without forgetting the path, opens in Files the first time it is attached, and stays pinned in the sidebar without replacing user bookmarks.
- Added a tray menu while Omarchy is running for reopening the VM, opening the shared folder, Settings, diagnostics, and clean shutdown. Start-menu installs also receive a separate Settings shortcut, including existing installs on their next successful launch.

### Fixes
- Fixed upgraded guest disks skipping newer launcher integration when the Linux kernel version had not changed. Existing v0.8 through v0.10 guests now receive the shared-folder link and Files bookmark without replacing the guest or user data.
- Kept folder sharing available with CPU rendering when the bundled WINQ-EMU runtime is installed.
- Invalid or unavailable saved folders no longer prevent Omarchy from starting. Unsafe broad, system, network, reparse-point, and VM-data paths are rejected before launch.
- Fixed Settings opening behind the maximized Omarchy window when selected from the tray.

## v0.0.10-preview - 2026-09-03

- Withdrawn during prerelease testing because upgraded guest disks could miss the new Files integration. Superseded by v0.0.11-preview.

## v0.0.9-preview - 2026-09-02

### Features
- Updated new and reset guest images to Omarchy 4.0.2, a security release covering sshd hardening, browser policy directories, sudoers tightening, and signed packages from the Omarchy repository. Existing writable guests keep their installed OS and user data; the updated initramfs adds the matching launcher integration without replacing them.
- Added disk-space checks before the large guest download, unpack, and writable-disk copy, using sizes from the authenticated guest manifest, so a full drive is reported before the expensive step instead of after a partial copy.
- Added an experimental offline portable mode (`-portable`) that runs from a payload and data folder beside the launcher, keeps all guest state on the removable drive, makes no setup-time network requests, and uses a compact QCOW2 overlay that survives drive-letter changes and works on exFAT. See docs/PORTABLE_USB.md.
- Added loopback-only port forwarding into Omarchy (`-forward tcp:8080:80`) and an opt-in SSH preset (`-ssh 2222`) that starts sshd for that session and authorizes your public key for the Omarchy account. Nothing listens unless asked, and nothing is reachable from the network.
- The shared folder now appears inside Omarchy under its own name (`~/Work` for `C:\Users\me\Work`) as well as at `/mnt/host`. The link is removed again on launches that share nothing, and a real folder with content is never replaced.
- Added `try-omarchy-export` inside the guest: one archive with your configuration, theme, and added packages plus a restore script for a real Omarchy install. See docs/MIGRATION.md.
- Added a settings window (`-settings`) and a persistent settings file (`settings.json` in the data folder) for fullscreen, guest memory, the shared folder, port forwards, and the SSH key, with matching flags that win for a single launch. `-memory` is new.
- Added `-diagnostics`, which writes one zip of launcher and QEMU logs, guest console output, settings, update state, and machine facts for bug reports.

### Fixes
- Stopped setup on ARM64 Windows PCs with a clear explanation instead of failing through a WHP feature enable, a reboot, and impossible BIOS advice. Try Omarchy remains x86_64-only.
- Fixed startup on PCs whose hypervisor refuses nested virtualization, such as Intel Core Ultra laptops and machines with the full Hyper-V feature set. The launcher now retries with the interrupt controller in QEMU instead of failing, and the source-built runtime no longer treats the refusal as fatal.
- Shipped yay and the base-devel toolchain in new and reset guest images, so Omarchy's AUR install and update flows work out of the box.
- Shipped Omarchy's LazyVim configuration and clang in new and reset guest images, so Neovim starts with the expected setup and Tree-sitter can compile parsers.
- Fixed screen recording in new and reset guest images, which never started because the recorder was missing, and shipped the other tools Omarchy's keybindings and menus expect: the screenshot editor, OCR and QR capture, emoji and clipboard paste, man pages, the calculator, writer and video trimmer, Herdr, and the screen-share picker.
- Kept launcher and guest-image rollback active until the booted guest reaches userspace and networking. QEMU's control socket alone can answer during a kernel panic, so it is no longer treated as proof that an update is healthy.
- Preserved existing writable guests when a release raises the virtual disk size. The launcher now grows the disk in place instead of mistaking it for an incomplete first-run copy and replacing it with the factory image.
- Bound portable QCOW2 data to the authenticated factory-image digest so replacing its backing payload is refused instead of risking silent filesystem corruption.
- Rebuilt the Windows runtime to avoid 1 ms SDL redraw polling while the guest is idle. Real-hardware idle CPU and graphics checks still gate publication.
- Raised the guest PipeWire quantum to prevent false underruns from QEMU's coarse emulated HDA position updates.
- Backported Omarchy's notification close control and kept notification contents hidden while the lock screen or screensaver is active.
- Hardened failed-update recovery, settings and receipt writes, clipboard size checks, audio fallback, directory setup, and diagnostics redaction.

## v0.0.8-preview - 2026-08-30

- Fixed the launcher quitting on its own after about half an hour. Omarchy kept running, but the Windows key and every Windows shortcut went back to Windows, and the window could no longer be closed normally.
- Fixed setup blaming your connection when the real problem was a full disk.
- Removed a stall of about a minute when the bundled runtime rolled back to its previous version.
- Added resumable downloads so an interrupted setup continues where it stopped instead of fetching the payload again, with bounded retries when antivirus or indexing briefly locks a finished file.
- Added version details to the launcher, so Explorer, Task Manager and the Windows permission prompt now show Try Omarchy instead of a blank entry.
- Added a source-locked CI build for the patched Windows QEMU runtime, including matching source, licenses, package inventory, provenance, and per-file hashes.
- Added isolated signed test launchers so runtime candidates can be exercised without changing the production payload.
- Hardened runtime packaging and validated clean setup, CPU fallback, scoped Windows-key handling, clipboard sharing, shutdown, relaunch, and persistent guest data in a nested Windows VM.
- Made text clipboard sharing survive late guest startup, Wayland reconnects, early Windows copies, and temporary Windows clipboard contention.
- Updated the guest image to nautilus 50.3 and fd 10.5.
- Known limitation: Win+L still locks Windows instead of reaching Omarchy. Windows reserves that shortcut and no application can intercept it, so rebind the Omarchy action if you need it.

Thanks to [Tom Ballard](https://github.com/tcballard) for resumable downloads in [PR #7](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy-windows/pull/7), and to everyone who reported Windows shortcuts leaking through while Omarchy was running.

## v0.0.7-preview - 2026-08-30

- Added CI for launcher builds, release-pin validation, and guest patch contracts.
- Added a two-phase release workflow that rebuilds and smoke-tests the guest, signs the optimized launcher through Azure OIDC, and verifies public downloads before marking a release Latest.
- Added authenticated automatic updates for the launcher, bundled runtime, and factory guest image, with staged installs and automatic rollback after a failed first boot.
- Added bounded retries for temporary DNS, connection, rate-limit, and server failures during setup downloads.
- Made instant-mode credentials explicit in the account choice, setup splash, and a one-time first-desktop notification.
- Removed the duplicate Windows pointer over the guest-rendered cursor, with `-host-cursor` retained as a diagnostic fallback.

Thanks to everyone testing Try Omarchy on real hardware and over remote sessions.

## v0.0.6-preview - 2026-08-29

- Added a stable launcher under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TryOmarchy` with optional Start-menu and Desktop shortcuts selected inside the branded setup window.
- Added an app compatibility guide covering Arch packages, VS Code, and current VM limitations.
- Added an optional instant trial account that skips the first-boot form and lands directly on the desktop.

Thanks to [Marx-Bray](https://github.com/Marx-Bray) for suggesting the launcher shortcuts in [issue #1](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy-windows/issues/1), and to everyone testing Try Omarchy across different Windows setups.

## v0.0.5-preview - 2026-08-29

- Reworked the setup splash with a clear SUPER-key explanation and starter shortcuts.
- Added safe cancellation that stops active downloads, removes partial setup data, and keeps the launcher.
- Authenticated the release manifest before downloading payloads and added recovery for incomplete installs.
- Prevented QEMU from trapping the Windows cursor when Try Omarchy is used over RDP.
- Documented essential keys, uninstalling, compatibility expectations, and common questions.

Thanks to [Tom Ballard](https://github.com/tcballard) for the release-manifest hardening and incomplete-install recovery in [PR #2](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy-windows/pull/2), and to everyone who tested the early previews and reported rough edges.

## v0.0.4-preview - 2026-08-29

- Kept the progress window visible until Omarchy opened.
- Sized guest memory to what the PC could spare and retried with less when needed.
- Kept setup errors visible above other windows.

## v0.0.3-preview - 2026-08-29

- Shipped the signed one-file Windows launcher.
- Added GPU runtime setup, graceful shutdown, clipboard sharing, folder sharing, and reliable guest reboot handling.
- Added the Omarchy 4.0.1 guest image used by later launcher releases.

## v0.0.2-preview - 2026-08-28

- Updated the guest to Omarchy 4.0.1 with all upstream themes.
- Added screensavers, autologin, clipboard sharing, host-folder mounting, and a visible SDL cursor.

## v0.0.1-preview - 2026-08-28

- First developer preview of Omarchy running under QEMU and WHPX on Windows.
